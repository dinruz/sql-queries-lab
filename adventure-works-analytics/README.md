#  AdventureWorks Analytics 

## 📝 Project Overview & Origin

The data used in this project originates from the **Microsoft AdventureWorks database**, a standard sample dataset that simulates the enterprise operations of a large-scale, multinational manufacturing company (**Adventure Works Cycles**). 

The database encompasses complex business scenarios. For the purpose of this project, a customized, localized schema was utilized to focus strictly on **B2C (Business-to-Consumer) sales analytics, customer demographics, and regional order distributions**.


## 💼 Business Context & Objectives

Adventure Works Cycles sells products globally. To drive executive decision-making, this project applies relational database principles to extract actionable insights from the transactional ledger. The analytical workloads are split into three logical phases:

1. **Data Discovery (`01_adventureworks_selections.sql`):** Initial data exploration, tracking high-value items, and filtering key customer attributes.
2. **Relational Analysis (`02_adventureworks_joins.sql`):** Deep queries traversing from the top-level product categories down through localized cities (`Grad`) and individual customer accounts (`Kupac`) to pinpoint buying patterns and inactive markets.
3. **Data Manipulation & Integrity (`03_adventureworks_dml.sql`):** Executing critical structural changes, archiving data into runtime tables (`SELECT INTO`), and handling strict relational boundaries (`Foreign Key Constraints`) during cascade delete operations.

## 📂 Project Navigation

To maintain a clean repository architecture, the source code and documentation have been separated:

* 📁 **[Scripts](scripts/)** - Folder containing the database initialization script (**`00_init_db.sql`**) and complete partitioned SQL analytical code:

    * **`01_adventureworks_selections.sql` (Core Data Retrieval & Filtering)**
        Focuses on basic data selection, logical filtering conditions (`WHERE`), pattern matching, and result set ordering (`ORDER BY`) to extract structured insights from baseline entities.

    * **`02_adventureworks_joins.sql` (Relational Data Synthesis & Multi-Table Joins)**
        Demonstrates relational data modeling through complex entity connections. Includes advanced implementations of `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT OUTER JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN` across transactional data, customer directories, and geographical tables.

    * **`03_adventureworks_aggregations.sql` (Advanced Analytics & Statistical Functions)**
        Showcases business intelligence (BI) capabilities using scalar, string, and mathematical functions (`ROUND`, `FLOOR`, `CEILING`). Features statistical aggregations (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`) coupled with multi-level grouping (`GROUP BY`) and conditional group filtering (`HAVING`).

    * **`04_adventureworks_dml.sql` (Data Manipulation Language & Transactional CRUD)**
        Covers the full lifecycle of transactional database modification. Contains 14 tasks including new regional data seedings (`INSERT`), advanced multi-table conditional overrides (`UPDATE`) and highly complex multi-stage cascade purges (`DELETE`) utilizing explicit relational constraints.

* 📖 **[Data Dictionary](adventureworks_data_dictionary.md)** - Full structural reference detailing table definitions, localized Croatian-to-English column mappings, and constraints.
